Dear Leandro, although we have experienced many hardships in our relationship, you have always been resilient in ensuring that our relationship continues to thrive. You have waited for me in my times of insecurity (which are definitely still occurring). You have been empathetic and understanding (in most situations). Despite my continuous agressions, you work past that because of your love for me, and I could not be more grateful. 

I have created this "website" to vaguely express my love to you in a format that you would appreciate, considering you're awesome at breaking apart computers and downloading ROM hacks, haha. I wanted to memorialize the timeline of our blossoming love in a virtual format that we can always access. In this brilliant coding love letter, I will not be giving names of certain people, locations, and situations that can be traced back to us (hopefully).

Pokémon means the world to me, so when I figured out how to download a Pokémon ROM hack by the name of insurgence, I was beyond ecstatic. Downloading that ROM hack took me ages considering I was decompressing files and putting documents where they shouldn't go Lol. Then, I met you, an aspiring medical student, and you came along and set up mods for our Stardew Valley experience. You showed how you put cheats into your ADHD cursor Skyrim game. And you even gave me the ability to play Pokémon with someone on my computer through PokeMMO. These might be miniscule to things to you or someone else, but they meant the world to me. To be able to access my childhood and always have Pokémon with me filled my heart with so much joy. To be able to share that experience with you was amazing. 

Despite all your shortcomings as a partner, you are a wonderful person. You're highly reactive but I appreciate your efforts when you take time for yourself to not get upset or angry. I am someone who has grown up with an emotionally stunted father, so to see you be so vulnerably and transparent with me about your feelings is refreshing. One of the main characteristics that drew me to you was your kindness towards me. Of course, you aren't kind to everyone but at least you displayed that with me due to your immense love for me, hehe. Although you were a liar when I met you, it was nice seeing how quickly your cold Deutscher heart warmed up to me. I loved seeing you come out of your shell and embrace your feelings and love for me. Getting to know you by making memories with you arguing, watching shows, planning our trip, and playing games has been rewarding. 

## Trip Through Memory Lane 

I would say our friendship was less serious when we used Discord so when we transitioned onto Whatsapp, it was a breaking moment. It was special to even have your number. Then you sent:

We've officially been friends since August 16,2024 so even though this initial Whatsapp message was sent in October, I wanted you so much. I loved your voice, I loved your rudeness, I loved your bullying, I loved your moments that could be interpreted as flirting. I didn't think we could be anything more than friends so I was just fine with fostering our friendship.

### Shared Interests

I wanted to feel closer to you, so I began engaging in your interests. I only began watching Breaking Bad so I could have something to talk to you about. I mean our conversations were pretty natural, but I felt a lot of pressure since I had to keep your attention. At that time, you would only text me a couple times on Discord but moving to Whatsapp helped increase the frequency of your messages. It was so cute getting an occassional message of yours. I attribute our friendship growing to me watching Breaking Bad and gushing about Jesse Pinkman, haha. I took the opportunity to send you Jesse Pinkman memes as a conversational topic, since our memes were similar (I think). I don't really enjoy watching series like these others than Greys Anatomy since I prefer Youtube videos, but this was a series you've expressed deep interest in. I wanted to feel a part of your life. 

### Gay Sammy Kätzchen

Another topic of conversation was Sammy and Layla Scheffler, my favorite Deutscher Katzen. Sammy is the cutest, chubby little orange angel. I correlate his presence to the healthy parts of our relationship, when lust and lack of resentment was at an all-time high. I'm not someone who enjoys seeing other people's pets, I prefer to help cure them. But seeing Sammy's huge eyes and rotund, obese body brought me such joy. Even though Sammy was unaware, he's been there since the beginning of our relationship. I know you feel the same way regarding Sammy considering you're overjoyed when you get to see him when you visit your older brother.
